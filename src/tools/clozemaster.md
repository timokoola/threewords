This is tool is a helper calculator to determine how many items I need to learn today to reach 19991 items studied by the end of 2022. Insert the count in the beginning of the day and it will calculate how many items need to be studied today. Saturday's are worth two days or their study goal is twice the normal day. For a full treatment on how this tool was done, check my [post on my tech blog](https://timokoola.dev/posts/20220213/)
