title: "Using Interrogative Pronouns to Indicate Every"

This is a short note about a grammar point where one uses interrogative pronouns to form sentences like "everyone knows" or "谁都知道". I've been trying to learn this all week through the Chinese Grammar wiki article [Expressing "every" with question words - Chinese Grammar Wiki](https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/Expressing_%22every%22_with_question_words#Structure).

This grammar point is not to be confused with similar [Expressing "some" with question words - Chinese Grammar Wiki](https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/Expressing_%22some%22_with_question_words)
