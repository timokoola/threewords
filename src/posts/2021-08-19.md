title: "Russian Verbs - Conjugation - part II"

[Yesterday](/post/2021-08-18/), I started going through conjugating Russian verbs in detail. I started easy, basic conjugation of the first type. As we already alluded to yesterday, the second conjugation is for the verbs that end in "-ить".

The second conjugation uses the endings "ю" (or "у"), "ишь", "ит", "им", "ите", and "ят" (or "ат") to replace "ить" at the end of the word


    я слышу - I hear
    ты слышишь - you hear
    он, она, оно слышит - he/she/it hears
    мы слышим - we hear
    вы слышите - you hear
    они слышат - they hear

Slightly less simple but still very predictable.
