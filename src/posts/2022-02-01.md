Today I encountered this Chinese Language Stack Exchange question [etymology - Which came first? Chinese 蘑菇 or Mongolian мөөг? ](https://chinese.stackexchange.com/questions/42970/which-came-first-chinese-%e8%98%91%e8%8f%87-or-mongolian-%d0%bc%d3%a9%d3%a9%d0%b3). Interesting question and exquisite answer that gives us the Chinese word for mushroom {% pinyin "蘑菇", "mo2 gu", "mushroom" %}.

Naturally, I also went and checked the Russian words for mushroom:

* мухомор - the red fly agaric
* поганка - poisonous mushroom
* белый гриб - porcini
* боровик - any mushroom related to porcini
