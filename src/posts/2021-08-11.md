Today's post is a quick one. I just wanted a handy reference of big numbers in Chinese. Let's start with 1000: {% pinyin "千", "qian1", "1000" %} Multiples of ten that get their own bespoke words are {% pinyin "万", "wan4", "10000" %} {% pinyin "亿", "yi4", "100 million" %}  {% pinyin "兆", "zhao4", "one trillion i.e. 10^12" %}
