Today I studied [Expressing "except" and "in addition" with "chule… yiwai" - Chinese Grammar Wiki](https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/Expressing_%22except%22_and_%22in_addition%22_with_%22chule%E2%80%A6_yiwai%22), which is a surprisingly hard (at least for me) grammar point.

The Chinese Grammar Wiki article is as excellent as always, but here is my personal brain dump:
* Use {% pinyin "除了", "chu2 le" %} ... ({% pinyin "以外", "yi3 wai4" %}), {% pinyin "都", "dou1" %} ... to express Expect for thing mentioned in A, everything in B is something else. For instance 除了咖啡， 我都喜欢喝。(except for coffee, I like to drink everything)
* Use {% pinyin "除了", "chu2 le" %} ..., {% pinyin "也", "ye3" %}/{% pinyin "还", "hai2" %} to express that not only A but also B all are something. For example 除了茶，我也很喜欢咖啡。(besides tea, I really like to drink coffee also)
