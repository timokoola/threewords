I came across this nice resource of [50 Feel Good Language Fixes](https://www.lindsaydoeslanguages.com/50-feel-good-language-fixes/) by [About Me - Lindsay Does Languages](https://www.lindsaydoeslanguages.com/all-about/about-lindsay-does-languages/). These are my favourite items:

* Learn a new idiom or expression.
* Change the language on your phone.
* Find a new show to watch in the language on Netflix/Disney+/streaming platform of choice.

My Siri speaks Chinese to me, and I am constantly looking for movies and TV series in Russian or Chinese, but I need to sharpen my idiom hunting skills...
