This blog post is a quick note of a grammar point I was reviewing today (and will have to revisit). First off - let the Chinese Grammar Wiki tell us:

> Complements are not a form of flattery (those are compliments); they're much more versatile than that!

and 

>  Complements provide additional information associated with verbs, such as degree, result, direction, or possibility, and are extremely common

For instance, "吃了完" ate (and finished eating) is a complement. The state complement describes the achieved state of an action. They usually are adjective phrases, but sometimes are also verb phrases. State complement pattern is "V/ADJ + 得 + state complement". Examples and a thorough explanation of the grammar point are available at [the definitive Chinese Grammar Wiki - State complement](https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/State_complement)
