Continuing with [yesterday's back to basics](/post/2021-09-28/) theme, I went through the basic grammar of "all". In Russian we have "ВСЕ" and Chinese has {% pinyin "都", "dou1", "all" %}

## Russian "all"

This video explains "all" in very good detail:

My own summary of the way I use it - that is independently as subject or object: "Всё" for plural agreement and "Всe" for when in singular. This is quite hard for me as Finnish "kaikki" almost never is in plural [see "kaiket" for the sole exception](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kaiket)


## Chinese "all"

Chinese {% pinyin "都", "dou1" %} [The "all" adverb "dou" - Chinese Grammar Wiki](https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/The_%22all%22_adverb_%22dou%22) is pretty easy to use. The main thing I have taught myself is that there is no separate word for both, even for two items it is {% pinyin "都", "dou1" %}.
