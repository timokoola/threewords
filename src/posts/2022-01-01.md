I decided that to keep up routines and help me better document progress, I would add (almost) daily journal entries to my blog. Today's words were: {% pinyin "太阳系", "tai4 yuan2 xi4", "Solar system" %}. This word is on the Skritter list about stars and planets. The nice introductory video is available on YouTube:

For Russian the word I went through in detail is: 
[событие - Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%8B%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%B5#Russian)  that means "an event, an incident".
