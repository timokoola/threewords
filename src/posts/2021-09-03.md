I just picked up the [Random Chinese Grammar Item](/tool/grammar) and studied [Offering choices with "haishi" - Chinese Grammar Wiki](https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/Offering_choices_with_%22haishi%22) from the excellent [Chinese Grammar Wiki](https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/).

Quick summary: Chinese has two ors {% pinyin "或者", "huo4 zhe" %} and {% pinyin "还是", "hai2 shi4" %}. One uses the first one in normal sentences and the second one only in questions, where a choice between two items is queried.
