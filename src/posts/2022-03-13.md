I started going through the book [An Introduction to Literary Chinese: Revised Edition (Harvard East Asian Monographs): Fuller, Michael A.: 9780674017269: Amazon.com: Books](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Literary-Chinese-Revised-Monographs/dp/0674017269) along with the course by Outlier Linguistics to learn "literary Chinese" which specifically means the written Chinese of the classics suchs as the [Analects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analects). Starting with the lesson one and its topic 16.9:
	
> 孔子曰：「生而知之者，上也；學而知之者，次也；困而學之，又其次也；困而不學，民斯為下矣。

I will be documenting my progress with the book over the next few months. First of, tomorrow, the words on this analect.
