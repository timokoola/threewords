Today I added some tools for the page I have planned to add here. First, there is [Random Grammar Point](/tool/random-grammar) that picks up a random grammar point from [Chinese Grammar Wiki](https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/) every day. This same tool I have earlier published as a [Scriptable widget for iOS](https://blog.timokoola.com/2020/10/13/another-day-another.html)

The second item is, for now, a simple page with [today's date in Russian and Chinese](/tool/dates).

I plan to create more of these and expand today "widget" to be more practical. I wonder if I could come up with something about numbers and verbs ðŸ¤”.
