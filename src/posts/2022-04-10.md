Ah, long time, no write. Moved houses, but the my Skritter and Clozemaster habits kept going. These four words have caused me grief lately:

{% pinyin "盛行", "sheng4 xing2", "in vogue, to be prevalent" %}

Following sound-alikes are also putting extra gray hair on me.
{% pinyin "接", "jie1", "to receive, to answer" %}
{% pinyin "揭", "jie1", "to take the lid off; to expose; to unmask" %}
{% pinyin "捷", "jie2", "victory, triumph, Czech" %}
