Today, I wanted to review these four words that are causing me gray hair:

{% pinyin "茫", "mang2", "vast, boundless" %}
{% pinyin "诚挚", "cheng2 zhi4", "sincere, cordial, earnest"%}
{% pinyin "烫", "tang4", "to burn, scald, scalding hot, to iron"%}
{% pinyin "多亏", "duo1 kui1", "thanks to, luckily" %}
