This blog post is the last of the present/future conjugations for verbs, and it is the sometimes feared category of "irregular verbs". Luckily, in Russian irregular verbs are far less irregular compared to for instance English. Most of them follow familiar patterns, one just needs to know the exceptional forms. Examples of irregular verbs are:

* [жить](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D0%B6%D0%B8%D1%82%D1%8C#Verb) — to live
* [понять](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BD%D1%8F%D1%82%D1%8C#Conjugation) — to understand
* [дать](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D0%B4%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8C#Conjugation) — to give
* 

There are many good online resources on irregular verbs. My new favourite one is [The Ultimate Guide to Russian Verbs: Both Irregular and Regular](https://speechling.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-russian-verbs-both-irregular-and-regular/) which goes to great details in explaining the exceptions.
