Another one of my sticky posts and by coincidence it also works well within the context of language learning {% pinyin "循序渐进", "xun2 xu4 jian4 jin4", "in sequence, step by step (idiom); to make steady progress incrementally" %} or in traditional  {% pinyin "循序漸進", "xun2 xu4 jian4 jin4", "in sequence, step by step (idiom); to make steady progress incrementally" %}

What it means is explained in detail in this [循序渐进_百度百科 (Baidu wiki)](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%BE%AA%E5%BA%8F%E6%B8%90%E8%BF%9B/1912485)
