I've been lately going through adverbs of place with the help of [Learn language in context - Clozemaster](https://www.clozemaster.com/) and this is what I've learned:

* где - where
* Куда - where to
* Здесь - here (like "at/in here")
* сюда - here (as in to here)
* туда - to there
* там - there
* Откуда - from where
* Отсюда - from here
* Оттуда - from there
