During the last few days, I've struggled with these two Chinese words:

{% pinyin "欣慰", "xin1 wei4", "be gratified, to be satisfied" %}

For some reason, I've had a hard time putting this word into my long term memory. My go-to trick of using [Outlier Dictionary of Chinese Characters](https://www.outlier-linguistics.com/products/outlier-dictionary-of-chinese-characters) to dig up the origins and meaning chains for the word, doesn't work as this word is not present in that word set.

The second hard word is {% pinyin "恍","huang3","disappointed， flurried，indistinct" %}.
