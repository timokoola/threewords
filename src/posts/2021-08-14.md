Stumbled into this today, funny and perhaps a unnecessarily intimidating:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="zh" dir="ltr">Nothing to worry about, new students of Chinese. No frustrations await you.<br><br>衣农<br>未末<br>土士<br>瓜爪<br>度席<br>子孑<br>日曰<br>午牛<br>已己<br>舟丹<br>九丸<br>洒酒<br>今令<br>环坏<br>特持<br>辛幸<br>耍要<br>师帅<br>旱早</p>&mdash; Tanner Brown (@luoshanji) <a href="https://twitter.com/luoshanji/status/1426375073359925259?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 14, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Breaking up some the characters pair here:

{% pinyin "衣", "yi1", "clothes" %}
{% pinyin "农", "nong2", "agricultural-" %}
{% pinyin "未", "wei4", "not yet, did not" %}
{% pinyin "末", "mo4", "tip, end" %}
{% pinyin "土", "tu3", "earth, dirt, clay" %}
{% pinyin "士", "shi4", "e.g. specialist profession (护士) nurse" %}

One that I didn't recognize at all is {% pinyin "孑", "jie2", "solitary" %} but the pair I find the hardest is {% pinyin "洒酒", "sa3 jiu3", "to sprinkle - alcohol" %} Another nasty one is {% pinyin "日曰", "ri4 yue4", "sun, day - to read" %}but like many of these pairs are hard to mix up in real life as the other one is far more common and the contexts are quite different.
