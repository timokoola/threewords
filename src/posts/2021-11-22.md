This blog post was born through a random encounter with the word {% pinyin "而", "er2", "and, but, implies contrast"  %}

I have encountered this word in texts, but I did not know how it differed from the other words meaning roughly the same. 

This conjunction connects and puts a contrast between two sentences as, explained (once again) by Chinese Grammar Wiki: [Using "er" to explain contrasting ideas - Chinese Grammar Wiki](https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/Using_%22er%22_to_explain_contrasting_ideas)
