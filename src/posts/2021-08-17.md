I noticed my date shortcodes didn't work in the [Today page](/tool/dates). I needed to create manual ways to generate Russian and Chinese dates. While Chinese dates are extremely straightforward (number + month = name of the month, week + number = weekday), Russian dates require some work.

## Russian Months

I read this [Russian months' names and their etymology - Liden & Denz](https://lidenz.ru/russian-months-names/), and it is a good reference on the matter.

<dl>
{% for m in rudata.months %}
<dt>{{m.en}}</dt><dd>{{m.ru}}</dd>
<br />
{% endfor %}
</dl>

## Russian Weekdays

The same site has this nice list of weekdays and some additional info [Days of the Week in Russian: Learning the Basics](https://www.russiantutoring.com/post/days-of-the-week-in-russian-learning-the-basics).

<dl>
{% for wd in rudata.weekdays %}
<dt>{{wd.en}}</dt><dd>{{wd.ru}}</dd>
<br />
{% endfor %}
</dl>
