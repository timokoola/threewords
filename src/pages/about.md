## Documenting my Language Learning Habits

This blog is an open to the world notebook of my language learning. I had a similar project at [my micro-blog](https://blog.timokoola.com) for learning Russian, but I decided it was time to give it more room to develop and extend to my other languages of interest: Chinese, Spanish, Swedish and perhaps French and Estonian in the future. There will be a daily blog post with three words I learned that day with notes and occassional blog posts with more information 

## Goals

I have following goals w/re these languages (as of August 2021):

* Chinese - eventually read the hardest texts in this language and converse naturally with someone who can only speak Chinese
* English - read whatever I please, write even the hardest texts and converse about anything with anyone with a natural, fluent accent
* Swedish - maintain the current "can follow the TV news and read a newspaper" and expand to more fluent speaking
* Russian - be able to survive tourist life without switching to English
* Spanish - be able to survive tourist life without switching to English

## How Do I Study These Languages Today

I practice Chinese vocabulary daily using [Skritter](https://skritter.com/) and I get lessons from iTalki every week. English and Swedish I maintain by following media. Russian I learn with my partner, we exchange daily audio recordings of the same sentence in Finnish and Russian and most Russian posts here are based on those lessons.


## About Technology

This blog was built with Eleventy and runs on Netlify. I used Stephanie Eckles' excellent [5t3ph/11ty-netlify-jumpstart](https://github.com/5t3ph/11ty-netlify-jumpstart) as a starting point. This blog is very much work in progress (and best viewed on Netflix Navigator ðŸ˜…).
